# Prerequisites

- A private server remaining ON to run the background application (Linux like), reachable in a protected network area only (public version with authentication will come later),
- One or more clients to display and control the dashboard via a Chrome browser (tablet, computer, mobile phone...).
- Server part is not compatible with Microsoft Windows OS. Web part is compatible with Google Chrome & Chromium only, >= 71.


# Deeper in the main goals of this project
 
- A NodeJS stateful server allows constant monitoring, background actions or programmed behaviors of your domotics stuff. Made to fit a small hardware configuration like a Raspberry Pi2. 
- A modern & responsive web interface that displays a dashboard is permanently connected to the server to control everything. You make your dashboard with what you want _(as long as there is a plugin for that)_.
- Every domotics features are bundled in third part plugins. You choose the plugins you need, only.
